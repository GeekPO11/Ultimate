## 1. UI/UX Modernization

### 1.1 Design System Updates

#### Colors
- **Implement Material You-inspired dynamic color system**
  - Create color extraction from user photos to personalize the UI
  - Add support for color harmonization across the app
  - Implement subtle color transitions between screens

#### Typography
- **Refine typography system**
  - Update to use SF Pro and SF Pro Display consistently
  - Implement dynamic type with proper scaling
  - Add custom typography styles for headlines with proper tracking

#### Components
- **Glass Morphism**
  - Update `CTCard` to support true glass morphism with backdrop blur
  - Add translucency effects to navigation bars and tab bars
  - Implement depth effects with parallax on scrolling

```swift
// Example Glass Card implementation
struct GlassCard<Content: View>: View {
    var content: Content
    
    init(@ViewBuilder content: () -> Content) {
        self.content = content()
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        content
            .padding()
            .background(.ultraThinMaterial)
            .background(
                VisualEffectBlur(blurStyle: .systemUltraThinMaterialLight)
            )
            .cornerRadius(16)
            .shadow(color: Color.black.opacity(0.1), radius: 10, x: 0, y: 5)
    }
}
```

#### Animations & Transitions
- **Fluid Animations**
  - Implement spring animations for all interactive elements
  - Add subtle micro-interactions (button presses, toggles, etc.)
  - Create smooth transitions between views with shared element transitions

#### Layout
- **Spatial Layout System**
  - Implement a consistent spacing system with proper visual hierarchy
  - Create depth with layered UI elements
  - Use 3D transforms for subtle depth effects on cards and buttons
